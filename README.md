# Credit Card Challenge

### Intro

We want to write a system that allows our admins to submit a bunch of credit card
numbers for validation.

### Requirements

Build a front-end application that can do the following:

- [x] Allow the user to submit credit card details, including the country that it is
      from.
- [x] Check the specified country to make sure it doesn’t exist in a list of banned
      countries.
- [x] Make the list of banned countries configurable.
- [x] If the card is valid – store it somewhere for the session.
- [x] Display all the credit cards that have been captured during the session.
- [x] Don’t capture the same card twice.
